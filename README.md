# harmony
By Nikhil Kundu & Shubham Goda (nk553 & svg24)


We wish to create Harmony, which will be a social music listening site that allows users to
explore and listen to music from different languages and genres around the world.

In MS2, we have connected our Firebase database to the web application, to store songs and their audio files, and available languages.
