# harmony
By Nikhil Kundu & Shubham Goda (nk553 & svg24)

We wish to create Harmony, which will be a music listening site that allows users to
explore and listen to music from different languages and genres around the world.

On the favorite songs page, you can add your own favorite songs that will be saved according to who's logged in. On the languages page, you can explore music from different languages around the world. On any page with a list of songs, click play next to the song of your choice. Then, click pause anytime to pause that song (which can be replayed where it was left off). Clicking play while the song is playing will cause the song to restart.
